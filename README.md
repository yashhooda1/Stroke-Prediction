# Stroke-Prediction
Did a project in R aimed at predicting the likelihood of a patient getting a stroke based on a variety of health factors. The goal of this project is to help a health organization reduce the number of strokes in its patient population and use machine learning models to improve patient outcomes.
At the conclusion of the project, it was found that patients who are older, have a higher BMI, no history of heart disease, never smoke, higher then average glucose levels, little to no hypertension, identify as female, live in urban areas, were married, and worked private jobs were at a higher risk of stroke compared to those who did not.
