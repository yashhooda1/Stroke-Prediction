# About Data Analysis Report

This RMarkdown file contains the report of the data analysis done for the project on building and deploying a stroke prediction model in R. It contains analysis such as data exploration, summary statistics and building the prediction models. The final report was completed on `r date()`. 

**Data Description:**

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.

This data set is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.

- **Accuracy:** Measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
- **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
- **Recall (Sensitivity):** The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
- **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
- **ROC Curve:** A graphical representation of the model's performance across different thresholds.


#calculate other metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
precision <- confusion_matrix[2, 2] / sum(confusion_matrix[, 2])
recall <- confusion_matrix[2, 2] / sum(confusion_matrix[2, ])
f1_score <- 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)

# Plot ROC Curve
library(pROC)
roc_curve <- roc(test_data$stroke, as.numeric(predictions))
plot(roc_curve)


#Findings and Conclusions
#Based on roc curve, there is strong evidence to suggest that the model is effective at identifying people who are likely to have a stroke, however the model is less effective at identifying people who are not likely to have a stroke and may classify individuals at risk for having a stroke when they are actually not at risk which explains the low accuracy score based on the actual and predicted values. Therefore this study should be taken with a grain of salt. Based on the data provided, there is evidence to suggest that patients who are older, have a higher BMI, no heart disease, never smoke, higher then average glucose levels, little to no hypertension, identify as a female, live in urban areas, married, and work at private jobs are at a higher risk of stroke.
